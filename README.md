# Program #6 Coding with GenAI
## Program
The problem that we want AI to write a solution to is Snow Fall Report from CS 141

## Prompt Planning
Some things we might need to use in our prompt, or follow up prompts, include:
* a main method that stores two city name, their snowing day and amount by inches
* a void method prints the introduction
* a string method used for asking user's name of snowing city
* a double method that returns the days of snowing and snowing amount of each day
* a void method prints the total snowing amount of each city and compare who snows more

## Reflection
Gen AI is able to meet all rrequirement from this code and run it smoothly, no bugs or error occured.
We observed that GenAi is a great tool to help us coding, but we can't rely on GenAI too much since there's still a chance it will make mistakes.
